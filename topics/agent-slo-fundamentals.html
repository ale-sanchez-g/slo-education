                        <h3>Identify Critical User Journeys</h3>
                        <p>Start by mapping the key interactions your users have with your service. A <strong>Critical User Journey (CUJ)</strong> is a sequence of steps a user takes to achieve a specific goal — for example, "user logs in and loads their dashboard".</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Interview product and business stakeholders to surface the most important workflows</li>
                            <li>Prioritise journeys that directly affect business outcomes (revenue, retention, satisfaction)</li>
                            <li>Limit your initial scope to three to five journeys to keep the effort manageable</li>

                        <h3>Define Service Level Indicators (SLIs)</h3>
                        <p>An <strong>SLI</strong> is a quantitative measure of some aspect of the service level being provided. Good SLIs are directly correlated with user experience.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Availability:</strong> proportion of successful requests over total requests</li>
                            <li><strong>Latency:</strong> proportion of requests served within a defined time threshold</li>
                            <li><strong>Throughput:</strong> rate of successful operations per unit of time</li>
                            <li><strong>Error rate:</strong> proportion of failed requests over total requests</li>
                            <li><strong>Freshness:</strong> age of the most recently updated data (for data pipelines)</li>

                        <h3>Set Measurable SLO Targets</h3>
                        <p>An <strong>SLO</strong> is a target value or range for an SLI over a rolling window. Business stakeholders must agree that the target reflects a level of service worth pursuing.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Anchor targets to historical performance and user pain thresholds</li>
                            <li>Start slightly below your current measured reliability (avoid setting aspirational, unachievable targets)</li>
                            <li>Use a rolling window (28 days or 30 days) to smooth out short-term noise</li>
                            <li>Document the business rationale for each target so teams understand the "why"</li>

                        <h3>Calculate and Manage the Error Budget</h3>
                        <p>The <strong>error budget</strong> is the amount of unreliability you are permitted before breaching your SLO. It turns reliability into a shared resource that development and operations teams can reason about together.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Error budget = 1 − SLO target (e.g. a 99.9% SLO gives a 0.1% error budget)</li>
                            <li>When the budget is healthy, teams can ship faster; when it is depleted, reliability work takes priority</li>
                            <li>Track burn rate alerts to detect budget depletion before it becomes critical</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Review and Iterate</h3>
                        <p>SLOs are living agreements. Schedule regular reviews with business and engineering stakeholders to ensure your objectives remain relevant as the service evolves.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Review SLOs quarterly or after significant architectural changes</li>
                            <li>Tighten targets when users demand higher reliability and the team has capacity</li>
                            <li>Loosen targets temporarily after major incidents to allow safe recovery space</li>
                            <li>Use post-incident reviews to feed learnings back into SLI definitions</li>

                <h2>Key Principles for Business-Aligned SLOs</h2>
                <div class="cards">
                    <div class="card">
                        <h3>Start with the User</h3>
                        <p>SLOs should reflect the experience of a real user, not internal system metrics. Ask "does this metric capture whether the user successfully achieved their goal?" before adopting an SLI.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="card">
                        <h3>Keep It Simple</h3>
                        <p>Fewer, well-chosen SLOs are more actionable than a large number of rarely reviewed ones. Aim for one to three SLOs per Critical User Journey and expand only when the team has built the muscle to manage them.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="card">
                        <h3>Make Them Visible</h3>
                        <p>SLOs only drive behaviour when they are visible to the whole team — engineers, product managers, and business stakeholders alike. Dashboard radiators, Slack alerts, and weekly digest emails all help keep SLOs top of mind.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="card">
                        <h3>Agree on Consequences</h3>
                        <p>Define in advance what happens when the error budget is exhausted. Common policies include freezing feature deployments, convening a reliability review, or escalating to senior leadership. Written policies reduce ambiguity during high-stress incidents.</p>

                        <p>If you are already invested in a platform like Datadog or Google Cloud, start with its native SLO features to reduce operational overhead. You can always migrate to a more portable format later.</p>

                        <p>Teams operating across multiple cloud providers or with a diverse observability stack benefit from a dedicated SLO layer (Nobl9) or an open standard (OpenSLO) to avoid fragmented SLO definitions.</p>

                        <p>Open-source solutions like Prometheus + Sloth are cost-effective at scale but require operational investment. Commercial platforms offer managed experiences that reduce toil but add licensing costs.</p>
