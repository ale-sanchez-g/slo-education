                    <h4>4.1 What Are Cookies</h4>
                    <p>Cookies are small text files stored on your device when you visit our website. They help us improve your experience and understand how our site is used.</p>

                    <h4>4.2 Types of Cookies We Use</h4>

                        <li><strong>Essential Cookies:</strong> Store your cookie consent preferences (localStorage)</li>

                    </ul>

                    <h4>4.3 Your Cookie Choices</h4>

                    <h3>5. Third-Party Services</h3>
                    
                    <h4>5.1 Google Analytics</h4>
                    <p>If you consent to analytics, we use Google Analytics to collect and analyze website usage data. Google Analytics uses cookies and may collect your IP address (which we anonymize). For more information about how Google uses data, visit: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Privacy Policy</a></p>

                    <h4>5.2 External Links and Embedded Content</h4>
                    <p>Our website contains links to external resources and an embedded iframe from agent37.com. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these third-party sites. We encourage you to read their privacy policies.</p>

                    <h3>6. Data Security</h3>
                    <p>We implement reasonable security measures to protect the information we collect. Our website uses HTTPS encryption for secure communication. However, no internet transmission is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

                    <h3>7. Data Retention</h3>
                    <p>Analytics data collected through Google Analytics is retained according to Google's data retention policies (typically 26 months). Your cookie consent preference is stored in your browser's local storage indefinitely until you clear it.</p>

                    <h3>8. Your Rights Under Australian Privacy Law</h3>
                    <p>Under the Australian Privacy Act and APPs, you have the right to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Access:</strong> Request access to personal information we hold about you</li>
                        <li><strong>Correction:</strong> Request correction of inaccurate personal information</li>
                        <li><strong>Complaint:</strong> Lodge a complaint if you believe we have breached the Australian Privacy Principles</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Since we collect minimal personal information (only anonymized analytics data if you consent), access and correction requests may be limited.</p>

                    <h3>9. International Data Transfers</h3>
                    <p>If you consent to analytics, your anonymized data may be transferred to and stored on Google's servers, which may be located outside Australia (including in the United States). Google is certified under relevant data protection frameworks.</p>

                    <h3>10. Children's Privacy</h3>
                    <p>Our website is not directed to children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

                    <h3>11. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
                    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.</p>
